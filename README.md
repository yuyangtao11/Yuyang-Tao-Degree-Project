# Yuyang-Tao-Degree-Project
Here is the code repo for the degree project: **Causal Reasoning for Predictive Health Modeling**

The project involves working directly with patient medical records to build models that can reduce the risk of (re)admissions by correctly implementing proactive measures for the right patients. By analyzing real-world medical data and focusing on high-risk patients, we aim to minimize the need for hospital admissions, allowing patients to receive primary care and other digital support interventions instead.
