# Yuyang-Tao-Degree-Project
Here is the code repo for the degree project: **Causal Reasoning for Predictive Health Modeling**

The project uses electronic‐health‐record (EHR) data to forecast 30‑day readmission and to uncover the patient factors that drive those outcomes. It combines high‑performing machine‑learning predictors with three state‑of‑the‑art causal‑discovery pipelines (Nonlinear‑NOTEARS, FCI + RCIT, and DECI) for patient‑specific intervention planning.
